What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies? Also, give the advantages and disadvantages of the round robin scheduling policy originally implemented in Xinu.
Linux like:
Advantage:
1. No starvation.
2. Processes which wait for I/O or enter into waitingg state 
Disadvantage:
1. Complexity
2.Processes cannot start if created in between an epoch even if it has very high priority.
3. If a process has very low priority, then it goodness can not increase a lot resulting in starvation.


Exponential:

Advantages:
1.No starvation.
Disadvantages:
1.High priority processes get very less CPU cycles in comparison.

Xinu:
Advantage: Equal priority processes get equal CPU time.
Disadvantage:It is priority based scheduling. Starvation of lower priority processes.


Describe the way each of the schedulers affects the NULL process.
Exponential: When there are no processes in the ready queue (i.e.no runnable processes only then the null process gets scheduled.
Linux Like: As the linux like policy uses goodness as a parameter for scheduling, then there is a possibility that null process can get scheduled if, any of  the runnable process has non zero quantum and zero goodness for current epoch.
